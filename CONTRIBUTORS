If you know how to use GIT and make pull-requests.
Please add your name as group project leader.
You can suggest a topic or pick from this:

- attendance verification 
- calendar (should be based on fullcalendar.js)
- assignment upload (should use Field(...type='upload')
- grading interface (should use ractive.js)
- customizable layout (based on bootstrap 2.0 styles)
- user polling system (ask, I have example)
- class recording (screen-o-matic?)
- class video chat (google hangout api?)
## Nick Groos - github: groos
- system wiki
## Jialiang Chang - github: aiolos404
- documentation integration (every group is responsible for providing documentation of their work but one group should be responsible for assembling the docs into a manual)
- testing (manual testing for now, you will have to write periodic reports to the groups about your tests)
